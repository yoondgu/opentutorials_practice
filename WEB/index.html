<h2>WEB</h2>
<p><p style="margin-bottom:45px;">The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web"target="_blank"title="web specification"><strong>Web</strong></a>, is an information system where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as https://example.com/),<br> which may be interlinked by hyperlinks, and are accessible over the Internet.</p>
<p>The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser,<br> and are published by a software application called a web server. <br>The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet, which pre-dated the Web in some form by over two decades and upon the technologies of which the Web is built.</p>
